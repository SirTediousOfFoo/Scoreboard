# Scoreboard
A simple scoreboard app with a timer

A score keeping Android application made in Processing 3.0. 
Currently the timer is hardcoded to countdown from 3 minutes but a menu is planned.

Current features:
  - Increase/decrease score for either red or yellow side
  - A start/stop button for the timer
  - A slightly buggy reset option
 
Planned features:
  - Timer setup
  - Team color picker
  - A reset function that doesn't have slight bugs
  - Possibly a way to save the score of every match to a cloud service but this one's just a possibility for a future time
  
Intended use is for HEMA refrees but it can obviously be used for anything.
